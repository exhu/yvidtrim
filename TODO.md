- review new systems refactoring result
- introduce a hover system and demonstrate how hover can be implemented with this together with
keeping current hover controller in guidemo

looks like does not fit the proper paradigm, it should be a system rather than
a controller for multiple controls like hover effect, however can be used
to accept data model name and resolve field names to controls:
	- WidgetViewController to support controllers that only need Widget as a view and
	registered via registry. --
	- addView method may support multiple Views or error if already added view

- add named controller registry and wiring logic, so that View.addToController is used
instead of manually adding views to controllers for HoverButton
- check if it's ergonomically better
- the controller stack is still manipulated manually by the code (View components do not push/pop them),
however named controllers should be created in advance and live in the runtime registry.

- discarded for now:
	- composite controller? e.g. a modal dialog owns several controllers so that the stack can skip
	all events when a modal controller is active?
	- add to View component controller name, so user registers a map of controllers and then
	views and controllers are automatically pushed -- can be problematic if the widget should be
	visible but change behaviour? Modal component?

	if view requests controller push, and controller can hide view, then there's cycle.


- video player component and system is external to yguilib to be independent from ffmpeg


- mouse capture component to capture mouse (and hide cursor) to implement
knobs
- build widget library
-- button with hover
-- combobox
- styles
- add image support

- assets management (transparent mapping to embedded import string and file stream data)
- extended font management (proper name, styles)
- define modal controller rules (some controllers must still handle events, when modal is active)
- add modal dialog displayed by model on key (and closed by click)
- button
- focus
- modal dialog
- text input
